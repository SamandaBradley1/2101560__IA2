    <p>
		 <h3>My Strongest Trait: Resilience, Ambition, and Determination</h3>
        I think the best adjectives to describe Samanda are unquestionably tenacious, ambitious, and determined. These characteristics have had a big impact on my academic career. 
		These characteristics enable me to meet issues head-on rather than let them intimidate me. As Robert Jordan famously observed, "The willow bent when it had to and survived; the oak fought the wind and was broken." 
		In essence, I pursue my objectives with tenacity. I aim to be the willow. Jordan mentioned that I don't give up easily when faced with difficult assignments or even very tight deadlines. 
		Instead, I take advantage of opportunities and challenges to develop and learn in order to improve both as a student and as a person. I am able to maintain focus and keep striving for the best outcomes because of my determination 
		to achieve my goals, which will help me become the greatest student I can be. My drive to succeed motivates me to study harder so that I can achieve both my academic and extracurricular objectives.
    </p>
	
		<h3>My Hobbies: Reading, Surfing the Internet, and Listening to Music</h3>
		<p>
			My interests are essential to sustaining a healthy academic life. I can broaden my knowledge through reading outside of the classroom. My ability to communicate and think critically has improved greatly as a result. 
			The internet allows me access to useful educational resources in addition to being a source of enjoyment. I frequently use online resources to conduct research and deepen my expertise on a variety of topics. 
			The ability to examine and interpret numerous things in a way that is appropriate for a student can help me become a better student in the long run because of this.
			One of my favorite methods to decompress from stress and maintain my motivation is to listen to music. It significantly improves my entire mood and energy, which eventually makes protracted study periods more fun. 
			In essence, music helps me stay energized and concentrated while studying or working on homework.

			<h3>Personal Motto and Hero</h3>
			<p style="margin-top: 1; margin-bottom: 1; line-height: 1.5;">
				<em style = "color: red;" >"If you have no confidence, you are twice as defeated in the race of life,"</em> is my personal motto. Those were Marcus Mosiah-Garvey's exact words. This statement, which I chose, really emphasised 
				how crucial it is to have self-confidence and trust in oneself in order to succeed and overcome various obstacles that one may encounter in life. We all experience our own hardships in the <i style = "color: red;" >"race of life,"</i> which is why I chose this phrase.
				In essence, these obstacles may seem insurmountable if one doesn't believe in oneself. However, if you have confidence, you may approach obstacles proactively and come up with solutions. 
				Essentially, this is my own motto, which serves as a constant reminder to believe in myself and the abilities I possess.

					Marcus Mosiah Garvey is regarded as Jamaica's National Hero and is both an activist and a national leader in his native country. He is well renowned for giving energizing speeches, writing, and, of course,
					speaking out for the rights and empowerment of people not only in Jamaica but also among all black people.
					Marcus Mosiah-Garvey was my choice for hero because of his dedication to the empowerment of black people not just in Jamaica but also internationally. The Universal Negro Improvement Association, founded by
					Marcus Mosiah Garvey, is credited with introducing the concept of economic independence and pride in the black community. Heroes are typically selected based on their morals and principles. Marcus Mosiah Garvey
					is a gripping figure for many individuals who share his beliefs about the value of justice, equality, and self-assurance because of his reputation as a civil rights activist, supporter of black empowerment, and inspirational personality.
