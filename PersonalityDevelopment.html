    <h3 style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', cursive, sans-serif; color: black;">>The major reason for setting a goal is for what it makes of you to accomplish it.</h3>
	<p>
        Setting goals was the fourth pillar, which was discussed throughout the book. The book went in-depth on how to do this and recommended following the "Plan, Do, Check, Adjust" method. 
		Setting objectives essentially means making a deliberate choice about where you want to go and how you will get there. 
		One of the main factors in why someone sets a goal is what it requires of them to achieve it. When you have a goal to strive towards, it motivates you to go above and beyond because even though your 
		strategies for achieving it may vary, your ultimate objective won't. This pillar introduces me to the idea of how crucial it is for one to have objectives, I can apply this to my life. 
		Setting goals might help me develop personally because I might have to venture out of my comfort zone, learn new skills, and more in order to achieve them. It also helps me be more resilient since 
		I know there are alternative possibilities if the plan I have for achieving the goal is unsuccessful, so I can try again.

		 <h3 style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', cursive, sans-serif; color: black;">>Everyday has many opportunities, but only one best opportunity.</h3>
		<p>
			There are two forms of suffering in life that we must all experience at some point. One weights considerably more than the other. One must experience the discomfort of discipline or perhaps the discomfort of regret. 
			One weights a few ounces and the other tonnes, respectively, in weight. In essence, I can use this idea in my life because I've learned a lot about the importance of time. I discovered that I shouldn't postpone tasks that 
			I can complete today for tomorrow. I discovered that I should construct my own life and that understanding the distinction between importance and urgency is incredibly helpful. I'm going to live my life now, making the most of every day.

		<h2><a href="#" style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', cursive, sans-serif; color: #ff4d4d; font-size: 1em;"> Pillar Six </a></h2>
		 <h3 style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', cursive, sans-serif; color: black;">> Don’t join an easy crowd; you wont grow. Go where the expectations and the demands to perform are high.</h3>
		<p>
			Some people are simpler to remain as friends than it is to find new ones; this may be because of your shared past or a sense of familiarity. It's important to remember that the people I choose to surround myself with will have a big impact on how my life turns out. 
			The book explored the notion that successful people seek associations with like-minded individuals who push, challenge, and inspire them to advance.I discovered that I should categorise everyone I come into contact with by asking myself questions like, "What effects do these people have on me?" and more 
			questions such as that. Show me your company, and I'll tell you who you are, according to an adage from Jamaica. This chapter of the book has taught me to be cautious about the energy I choose to surround myself with and to determine whether or not they 
			should have complete access to me.

			<h3 style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', cursive, sans-serif; color: black;">> Formal education will make you a living. Self education will make you a fortune.</h3>
			<p> 
				Self-education is what a person learns on their own as they go through life. The book investigated the idea that we ought to never stop learning in order to develop our character and, ultimately, become better people. Throughout one's life path, one must continue to study because doing so opens 
				up opportunities for success, wellness, and spirituality. 
				As I believed it to be the most crucial, this was my favourite pillar out of the four chapters we were assigned to read. Since the majority of a person's life is spent after receiving a formal education, I make an effort to learn something new every day as I proceed through this trip we call life.
				After all, not everything required to navigate life can  be or will be taught at school. Therefore, It is important to learn something everyday.
